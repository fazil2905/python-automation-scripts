# Python Automation Scripts

A collection of small, practical Python scripts for automation, DevOps tasks, and cloud-related workflows.

This repo acts as a growing toolbox of reusable scripts for:

* System inspection
* File and directory operations
* Log processing
* CLI automation
* DevOps and infrastructure helpers
* AWS and cloud-related scripting (ongoing)

Each script is written to be simple, readable, and usable as a standalone utility.

## How to Use

Run any script directly:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

## Focus Areas

* Automation
* DevOps-style scripting
* Cloud & AWS utilities
* Real-world scripting over theory

New scripts will be added continuously as part of building practical automation tools.
